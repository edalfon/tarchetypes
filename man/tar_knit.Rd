\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target. Subsequent targets
can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
e.g. \code{tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))} is a
target named \code{downstream_target} which depends on a target
\code{upstream_target} and a function \code{f()}. In addition, a target's
name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
running the same pipeline should get the same results,
and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
(Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
You can recover the seed of a completed target
with \code{tar_meta(your_target, seed)} and run \code{set.seed()} on the result
to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.}

\item{path}{Character string, file path to the \code{knitr} source file.
Must have length 1.}

\item{tidy_eval}{Logical, whether to enable tidy evaluation
when interpreting \code{command} and \code{pattern}. If \code{TRUE}, you can use the
"bang-bang" operator \verb{!!} to programmatically insert
the values of global objects.}

\item{packages}{Character vector of packages to load right before
the target builds. Use \code{tar_option_set()} to set packages
globally for all subsequent targets you define.}

\item{library}{Character vector of library paths to try
when loading \code{packages}.}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
runs into an error. If \code{"stop"}, the whole pipeline stops
and throws an error. If \code{"continue"}, the error is recorded,
but the pipeline keeps going. \code{error = "workspace"} is just like
\code{error = "stop"} except \code{targets} saves a special workspace file
to support interactive debugging outside the pipeline.
(Visit \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html}
to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)}

\item{deployment}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}. If \code{"worker"},
the target builds on a parallel worker. If \code{"main"},
the target builds on the host machine / process managing the pipeline.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get built earlier
(and polled earlier in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}).}

\item{resources}{A named list of computing resources. Uses:
\itemize{
\item Template file wildcards for \code{future::future()} in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
\item Template file wildcards \code{clustermq::workers()} in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}}.
\item Custom target-level \code{future::plan()}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(plan = future.callr::callr)}.
\item Custom \code{curl} handle if \code{format = "url"},
e.g. \code{resources = list(handle = curl::new_handle(nobody = TRUE))}.
In custom handles, most users should manually set \code{nobody = TRUE}
so \code{targets} does not download the entire file when it
only needs to check the time stamp and ETag.
\item Custom preset for \code{qs::qsave()} if \code{format = "qs"}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(handle = "archive")}.
\item Arguments \code{compression} and \code{compression_level} to
\code{arrow::write_feather()} and \code{arrow:write_parquet()} if \code{format} is
\code{"feather"}, \code{"parquet"}, \code{"aws_feather"}, or \code{"aws_parquet"}.
\item Custom compression level for \code{fst::write_fst()} if
\code{format} is \code{"fst"}, \code{"fst_dt"}, or \code{"fst_tbl"}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(compress = 100)}.
\item AWS bucket and prefix for the \code{"aws_"} formats, e.g.
\code{resources = list(bucket = "your-bucket", prefix = "folder/name")}.
\code{bucket} is required for AWS formats. See the cloud computing chapter
of the manual for details.
}}

\item{retrieval}{Character of length 1, only relevant to
\code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
If \code{"main"}, the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
and sent to the worker before the target builds.
If \code{"worker"}, the worker loads the targets dependencies.}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()} to customize the
rules that decide whether the target is up to date.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean; suppress the progress bar and messages?}

\item{...}{Named arguments to \code{knitr::knit()}.
These arguments are evaluated when the target actually runs in
\code{tar_make()}, not when the target is defined.}
}
\value{
A \code{tar_target()} object with \code{format = "file"}.
When this target runs, it returns a character vector
of file paths. The first file paths are the output files
(returned by \code{knitr::knit()}) and the \code{knitr}
source file is last. But unlike \code{knitr::knit()},
all returned paths are \emph{relative} paths to ensure portability
(so that the project can be moved from one file system to another
without invalidating the target).
See the "Target objects" section for background.

\description{
Shorthand to include \code{knitr} document in a
\code{targets} pipeline.
}
\details{
\code{tar_knit()} is an alternative to \code{tar_target()} for
\code{knitr} reports that depend on other targets. The \code{knitr} source
should mention dependency targets with \code{tar_load()} and \code{tar_read()}
in the active code chunks (which also allows you to knit the report
outside the pipeline if the \verb{_targets/} data store already exists).
(Do not use \code{tar_load_raw()} or \code{tar_read_raw()} for this.)
Then, \code{tar_knit()} defines a special kind of target. It
1. Finds all the \code{tar_load()}/\code{tar_read()} dependencies in the report
and inserts them into the target's command.
This enforces the proper dependency relationships.
(Do not use \code{tar_load_raw()} or \code{tar_read_raw()} for this.)
2. Sets \code{format = "file"} (see \code{tar_target()}) so \code{targets}
watches the files at the returned paths and reruns the report
if those files change.
3. Configures the target's command to return both the output
report files and the input source file. All these file paths
are relative paths so the project stays portable.
4. Forces the report to run in the user's current working directory
instead of the working directory of the report.
5. Sets convenient default options such as \code{deployment = "main"}
in the target and \code{quiet = TRUE} in \code{knitr::knit()}.

\section{Target objects}{

Most \code{tarchetypes} functions are target factories,
which means they return target objects
or lists of target objects.
Target objects represent skippable steps of the analysis pipeline
as described at \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/}.
Please read the walkthrough at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html}
to understand the role of target objects in analysis pipelines.

For developers,
\url{https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories}
explains target factories (functions like this one which generate targets)
and the design specification at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/}
details the structure and composition of target objects.
