\title{Easy dynamic branching over known existing
input files or urls.}
\usage{
tar_files_input(
  name,
  files,
  batches = length(files),
  format = c("file", "url", "aws_file"),
  iteration = targets::tar_option_get("iteration"),
  error = targets::tar_option_get("error"),
  memory = targets::tar_option_get("memory"),
  garbage_collection = targets::tar_option_get("garbage_collection"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, name of the target.}

\item{files}{Nonempty character vector of known existing input files
to track for changes.}

\item{batches}{Positive integer of length 1, number of batches
to partition the files. The default is one file per batch
(maximum number of batches) which is simplest to handle but
could cause a lot of overhead and consume a lot of computing resources.
Consider reducing the number of batches below the number of files
for heavy workloads.}

\item{format}{Character, either \code{"file"} or \code{"url"}. See the \code{format}
argument of \code{targets::tar_target()} for details.}

\item{iteration}{Character, iteration method. Must be a method
supported by the \code{iteration} argument of \code{targets::tar_target()}.
The iteration method for the upstream target is always \code{"list"}
in order to support batching.}

\item{error}{Character of length 1, what to do if the target
runs into an error. If \code{"stop"}, the whole pipeline stops
and throws an error. If \code{"continue"}, the error is recorded,
but the pipeline keeps going.}

\item{memory}{Character of length 1, memory strategy.
If \code{"persistent"}, the target stays in memory
until the end of the pipeline (unless \code{storage} is \code{"worker"},
in which case \code{targets} unloads the value from memory
right after storing it in order to avoid sending
copious data over a network).
If \code{"transient"}, the target gets unloaded
after every new target completes.
Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
whenever another target needs the value.
For cloud-based dynamic files such as \code{format = "aws_file"},
this memory policy applies to
temporary local copies of the file in \verb{_targets/scratch/"}:
\code{"persistent"} means they remain until the end of the pipeline,
and \code{"transient"} means they get deleted from the file system
as soon as possible. The former conserves bandwidth,
and the latter conserves local storage.}

\item{garbage_collection}{Logical, whether to run \code{base::gc()}
just before the target runs.}

\item{priority}{Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get built earlier.
Only applies to \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}} and \code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}}
(not \code{\link[targets:tar_make]{tar_make()}}). \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}} with no extra settings is
a drop-in replacement for \code{\link[targets:tar_make]{tar_make()}} in this case.}

\item{resources}{A named list of computing resources. Uses:
\itemize{
\item Template file wildcards for \code{future::future()} in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_future]{tar_make_future()}}.
\item Template file wildcards \code{clustermq::workers()} in \code{\link[targets:tar_make_clustermq]{tar_make_clustermq()}}.
\item Custom target-level \code{future::plan()}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(plan = future.callr::callr)}.
\item Custom \code{curl} handle if \code{format = "url"},
e.g. \code{resources = list(handle = curl::new_handle())}.
\item Custom preset for \code{qs::qsave()} if \code{format = "qs"}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(handle = "archive")}.
\item Custom compression level for \code{fst::write_fst()} if
\code{format} is \code{"fst"}, \code{"fst_dt"}, or \code{"fst_tbl"}, e.g.
\code{resources = list(compress = 100)}.
\item AWS bucket and prefix for the \code{"aws_"} formats, e.g.
\code{resources = list(bucket = "your-bucket", prefix = "folder/name")}.
\code{bucket} is required for AWS formats. See the cloud computing chapter
of the manual for details.
}}

\item{cue}{An optional object from \code{tar_cue()}
to customize the rules that decide whether the target is up to date.
Only applies to the downstream target. The upstream target always runs.}
}
\value{
A list of two targets, one upstream and one downstream.
The upstream one does some work and returns some file paths,
and the downstream target is a pattern that applies \code{format = "file"}
or \code{format = "url"}.
}
\description{
Shorthand for a pattern that correctly
branches over known existing files or urls.
}
\details{
\code{tar_files_input()} is like \code{tar_files()}
but more convenient when the files in question already
exist and are known in advance. Whereas \code{tar_files()}
always appears outdated (e.g. with \code{tar_outdated()})
because it always needs to check which files it needs to
branch over, \code{tar_files_input()} will appear up to date
if the files have not changed since last \code{tar_make()}.
In addition, \code{tar_files_input()} automatically groups
input files into batches to reduce overhead and
increase the efficiency of parallel processing.

\code{tar_files_input()} creates a pair of targets, one upstream
and one downstream. The upstream target does some work
and returns some file paths, and the downstream
target is a pattern that applies \code{format = "file"},
\code{format = "url"}, or \code{format = "aws_file"}.
This is the correct way to dynamically
iterate over file/url targets. It makes sure any downstream patterns
only rerun some of their branches if the files/urls change.
