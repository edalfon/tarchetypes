#' @title Easy dynamic branching over known existing
#'   files or urls (raw version).
#' @export
#' @description Shorthand for a pattern that correctly
#'   branches over files or urls.
#' @details `tar_files_input_raw()` is similar to [tar_files_input()]
#'   except the `name` argument must be a character string.
#'
#'   `tar_files_input_raw()` creates a pair of targets, one upstream
#'   and one downstream. The upstream target does some work
#'   and returns some file paths, and the downstream
#'   target is a pattern that applies `format = "file"`,
#'   `format = "url"`, or `format = "aws_file"`.
#'   This is the correct way to dynamically
#'   iterate over file/url targets. It makes sure any downstream patterns
#'   only rerun some of their branches if the files/urls change.

#'   <https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/136> and
#'   <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/1302>.
#' @export
#' @inheritParams targets::tar_target
#' @return A list of two targets, one upstream and one downstream.
#'   The upstream one does some work and returns some file paths,
#'   and the downstream target is a pattern that applies `format = "file"`
#'   or `format = "url"`.
#'   Target objects represent skippable steps of the analysis pipeline
#'   as described at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>.
#'   Please see the design specification at
#'   <https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/>
#'   to learn about the structure and composition of target objects.
#' @param files Nonempty character vector of known existing input files
#'   to track for changes.
#' @param batches Positive integer of length 1, number of batches
#'   to partition the files. The default is one file per batch
#'   (maximum number of batches) which is simplest to handle but
#'   could cause a lot of overhead and consume a lot of computing resources.
#'   Consider reducing the number of batches below the number of files
#'   for heavy workloads.
#' @param iteration Character, iteration method. Must be a method
#'   supported by the `iteration` argument of `targets::tar_target()`.
#'   The iteration method for the upstream target is always `"list"`
#'   in order to support batching.
#' @param format Character, either `"file"` or `"url"`. See the `format`
#'   argument of `targets::tar_target()` for details.
#' @param cue An optional object from `tar_cue()`
#'   to customize the rules that decide whether the target is up to date.
#'   Only applies to the downstream target. The upstream target always runs.
